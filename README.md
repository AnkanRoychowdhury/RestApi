# Build a REST API with Node, Express MongoDB & Postman!

We will be creating a simple API that would allow people Create, Read, Update, Delete Ideas. We will do this by coding the data the users will be interacting with within our **IdeaApp** database and how it goes about manipulating them depending on what a user wants to do.

## Project Requirements and Dependencies

To get started with this tutorial, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download them from the official Node.js website.
Also we will use MongoDB as our Database so make sure you already have MongoDB installed and set up on your machine before starting this tutorial. Here is a link to a guide that MongoDB provides on their website: [MongoDB Installation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
Also you can use cloud.mongodb.com which you can easily use in any browser.
**We will be using** cloud.mongodb.com
As we are building only the Rest API we will focus on only backend and to test our API will use **POSTMAN**.
Make sure that you have postman in your system.

## Creating Project....

Here we will be using VS Code IDE for our project.
Follow project structure of this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AnkanRoychowdhury/RestApi)

 1. Run `npm install` in terminal.
 2. Create free cluster in cloud.mongodb.com and connect database using Atlas SQL
 3. Create `.env` file and add `DB_USERNAME=YOUR_CREATED_DATABASE_USER` & `DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_CREATED_DATABASE_PASSWORD`
 4. Don't forget to change the `URL` in `server.js` file with you MongoDB connection url.
